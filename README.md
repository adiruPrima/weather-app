3. The background changes dynamically based on the current weather conditions or time of day.
4. Users can search for weather information in different cities using the search functionality.

- `app.js`: Handles the weather data fetching, display logic, and user interactions

## Setup

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Make sure to replace the API key in the `app.js` file with your own OpenWeatherMap API key.
